Mohammed Mutlak Al-Azemi  
 Made his name first when he broke his national record in 2004. Made the WC semifinal in 2005. He started 2006 very promising scoring three more national records, winning two major races (Doha and Oslo) in the process. In 2007 he won at Oslo again but a further breakthrough did not materialize. At the 2008 Olympic games he managed to make the semifinals. He made the 2011 WC semis but dropped out of the race.  
Belal Mansoor Ali  
 Born as John Kipkorir Yego in Kenya. He switched allegiance to Bahrain in 2005. In that year he also became World Youth Champion at 1500m (his year of birth has been given as 1988 but this is controversial). He also finished 7th at the World Championship. In 2006 he had a another promising season over 1500m with a bronze medal at the World Junior Championships and a silver at the Asian Games. He improved a lot in 2007, setting Asian records for 1500m indoors and 1000m. He won several races at 1500m and also won a fast 800m in Rieti in a new PB. In 2008 he reached the Olympic semifinals. His 2009 WC campaign saw him reach the 1500m final and the 800m semifinals. He ran several 800m races in 2010 but concentrated on the 1500 from there on. 
Mohammed Al Salhi  
 Born under the name Kosgei in Kenya he obtained Saudi-Arabian nationality in 2002. He made the World Championship semifinals in 2003 and again in 2005 after setting a new national record that same year. Did well in 2006 and further improved his national record. In 2007 he reached the WC final. At the 2008 Olympics he made the semifinals. Set another new national record early in 2009 but after that his progress came to a halt and at the WC he went out in the heats. He somehow never refound his earlier levels. 
Mohammed Aman       
 Young Ethiopian runner (although his birthday may be controversial). He was the fastest African junior at the 2009 and 2011 African Junior championships (although his title in 2009 was later revoked because he was apparently too young!) and also came first at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics. His real breakthrough was a silver medal at the 2011 World Youth Championships when he ran 1:44 setting a new Ethiopian (senior) record. Later that year he improved his PB in the WC semifinal and reached the final, finishing 8th. In Rieti he impressively improved his PB by more than a second which meant another NR and also made him the fastest ever Youth athlete. In Milan he scored a surprise victory over . Early in 2012 he had a strong indoor season and in Istanbul he scored his first senior title when he became World Indoor Champion. Outdoors he won the races in Daegu and Rabat. At the Olympics he finished only sixth despite improving his PB.  In Zurich though he had his revenge when he beat  which also made him winner of the Diamond Race. Started well in 2013 with wins in Eugene, Rome and Lausanne. Later that year in Moscow he started as favourite and convincingly became  World Champion. In Brussels he won the fastest race of the season in a new PB, which brought him another victory in the Diamond Race as well.   Opened his 2014 indoor season with two fast wins and succesfully defended his World Indoor title. He won the first Diamond League meeting in Doha but was beaten in Eugene, and again in Monaco by . At the African Championships he took silver. His performance levels dropped rather sharply from 2015, when he still had a fine win at the Rome Diamond League meeting but in a few other races he was unable to finish up front. At the World Championships he failed to make the final when he was disqualified for running into another competitor. In 2016 he could not find top form and was unable to qualify from his Olympic semifinal. In 2017 though he did reach the WC final, finishing sixth. 
Nijel Amos       
 Sprang into fame in 2012 when he suddenly ran a blistering time out of nowhere during a  small meeting in Germany. His time catapulted him up the ranking lists. He also became the  second fastest athlete at 18 years old (behind  only). He won gold at the World Junior Championships. At the Olympic games he was able to stay fairly close to  for a terrific silver medal in a huge PB.   Injured in 2013, but returned in 2014 and beat a star studded field in Eugene. In Monaco he ran even better and won a race where five athletes ran 1:42 and set a World leading Time. At the CommonWealth Games he took gold with a very convincing finishing dash, beating  . Later that year he also became African Champion and won the Diamond League after a win in Zurich. In 2015 in his first serious race he again outpaced . He ran very fast in Monaco but was surprisingly beaten by . At the World Championships he disappointingly went out in the semifinals. He finished his season with a fast race in Berlin and won the 2015 Diamond Race on the 800m.  His 2016 season was disappointing and at the Olympics he went out in the heats. In 2017 he returned and won several Dimond League races. At the World Championships he finished fifth. His 2018 season hadn't looked great until he suddenly scored a magnificent win in Monaco in a world leading time of 1:42.14, the fastest run since the 2012 Olympic final. He ran anither fast rae in London two days later when his World lead was improved upon by   
Said Aouita 
 Arguably the most allround middle and long distance runner the world has ever seen, feared for his devastating sprint finishes. Won gold at the 1984 Olympic 5000m. Set a new WR at 5000m in 1985. The following month he broke 's 1500m WR just weeks after it was set. In 1987 he added the WR for 2000m. A week later he was the first to break 13 minutes at 5000m. World Champion in 1987 at 1500m. In 1988 his bid to add a major 800m title failed but he still picked up Olympic bronze. In 1989 he reached another landmark when his WR at 3000m broke the 7:30 barrier. Incredibly from 1989 to 1992 he held four WR's (1500-2000-3000-5000). 
Mehdi Baala 
 European 1500m Champion in 2002. The same year he set a spectacular French 800m record improving himself by more than two seconds. Early 2003 he went sub 1:45 indoors as well, lowering the French indoor record by a similar margin. Despite a few further solid 800m runs he concentrated his efforts on the 1500m and at the 2003 WC on home soil he took a 1500m silver medal. At the 2005 WC he disappointingly went out in the 1500m semis but did make the 800m final and finished sixth. He hit back in 2006 convincingly defending his European title at 1500m. In 2008 he took bronze at the Olympic 1500m. He held the French record for a total of twelve years until it was beaten by  in 2014. 
Jose Luiz Barbosa 
 Very consistent tall front runner with a long and distinguished career. A successful 1986 season was followed in 1987 by the World Indoor title and a bronze medal at the WC. In 1988 he started the Olympic final as one of the favourites, but went out too fast and came only 6th. He finished 2nd in the 1989 Indoor WC and remained among the top 800m athletes during the 1989 outdoor season, but hardly raced the next season. He came back strongly in 1991 however, when he won nearly all his races and set a seasons best of 1:43.08.  Although clearly the leading 800m runner of the year he had to be content with silver at the WC after being outsprinted by  The following year he finished 4th at the Olympics. His last big prize was winning the 1995 PanAm games. His total of 38 sub-1:45 marks still ranks among the all time top ten. 
Kipyegon Bett       
 He showed his talents early by winning silver at the 2015 World Youth Championships and becoming World Junior Champion one year later. That same year he already ran his first 1:43. In 2017 he came second at the Kenyan Trials and at the World championships won a bronze medal. His career was abruptly interrupted in 2018 when he tested positive for EPO and was banned for four years. 
Andrea Benvenuti 
 Fast finisher who came 5th in the 1992 Olympic final. His tactical awareness was ample compensation for his lack of sheer speed, as he showed when he became European Champion in 1994. Injuries forced him to retire early. 
Boris Berian       
 Made a succesful switch from 400m to 800m in 2015 and improved himself to 1:45 early in the season, then came second during the New York Diamond league meeting setting a new PB of 1:43, almost 1.5 seconds faster than his previous mark. At the US trials He was unable  to qualify for the World Championships. Later that year he again improved his PB, by exactly half a second. In 2016 he won gold at the World Indoor Championships. He also won at the  Eugene Diamond League meeting. Made the Olympic final, finishing eighth. Didn't run in 2017. 
Olaf Beyer 
 Had an exceptionally good season in 1978 when he won a silver medal at the European Indoor Championships. Later that year he took gold at the European Championship in the fastest time of the season ahead of English favourites  and . Now that the GDR has been disbanded that run will forever remain in the books as the national record. 
Abdi Bile 
 Majestic 1500m runner, occasionally participating in 800m as well. World champion at 1500m in 1987. Set an impressive national 800m record in 1989. 
Mike Boit 
 The 'Grand Old Man' of Kenyan 800m running. Came to the fore by winning a bronze medal at the 1972 Munich Olympics. He was also 4th at the 1500m. Won silver and gold at the 1974 and 1978 CW Games respectively but was denied his chances at further Olympic glory when Kenya decided to boycott the games in 1976 and again in 1980. Set a season's best in 1975 with 1:43.79, which was then just fractions outside the WR. Held the African record for nine years. Poignantly he had his best year in 1976, when his 1:43.57 missed 's world record by just 0.07 seconds. 
Yuriy Borzakovskiy  
 Unorthodox world class runner. Leapt into the international limelight when he became 2000 European Indoor Champion with an astounding display of even pace running, which also made him second fastest indoor of all time. Used similar tactics to reach the Olympic final and came 6th. He repeated his indoor efforts in 2001, this time becoming World Indoor Champion. His duels with  were the highlight of the 2001 season. Although he had only one win it did result in the fastest time of the season (also his PB). Inexplicably he didn't go to the 2001 WC. In 2002 he never quite found his best form. At the 2002 EC he mysteriously (and unsuccessfully) participated in the 400m. He had a return to form in 2003, breaking 1:44 four times. He looked ready to become World Champion but in the final accelerated slightly too early and had to settle for silver.  He started well in 2004, winning the first Golden League meeting. In Athens he paced the final exactly right and came from behind to win a glorious Olympic Gold. His form in 2005 improved after an indifferent  start, although he couldn't convert his role of favorite for the World Championship and after a tactical error had to be content with another silver behind the surprising . He looked a favorite for the 2006 World Indoor Championships but had to settle for bronze. Outdoors he had a superb win in Athens but few other notable performances. In the tactical  2007 WC final his trademark final dash brought him the bronze.   After a modest start in 2008 he had an excellent win in Monaco scoring the  second 1:42 time of his career. At the Olympic games however he disappointingly went out in the semifinals. Early in 2009 he became European Indoor Champion once more. A win in Oslo confirmed his good form. At the WC he made yet another final finishing fourth. In 2010 he missed most of the season because of a foot injury. But in 2011 he came back and scored his fourth World Championship medal as he took the bronze. In 2012 he won a convincing gold at the European Championships but during the 2012 Olympics he was unable to qualify from his semifinal. Illness prevented him from running at the 2013 World Championships in Moscow. He announced his retirement the following year.  He is the only athlete to break 1:45 indoors five times. He is also still third (behind   two world records and  on the all  time World Indoor list, holding marks 4 to 7 since 2003. His usual strategy was to lag well behind during the first lap and to move spectacularly forward on the second lap, thus running the distance with even pace throughout.  This resulted in some glorious and spectacular wins such as at the 2004 Olympics. His risky tactics didn't always pay off though, notably at the World Championships, where he made the final five times, coming 2nd, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 3rd but was somehow unable to finish first. 
Pierre-Ambroise Bosse       
 French runner who first broke 1:45 in 2012 when he also won a bronze medal at the  European Championships and made the Olympic semifinal. Started very well in 2013 improving his PB in Doha and again in Rome when he took almost a second of his PB and broke 1:44 as well.    In Monaco he ran yet another PB. At the World Championships he reached the final and came 7th. After a steady start in 2014 he ran a glorious race in Monaco and finished in a new French record. At the European Championships he led for most of the final but blew up and came last. In 2015 he started too fast in many races, finishing way down the field. At the WC he made the final finishing fifth. In 2016 he ran well but success just eluded him. At the 2016 EC he came fifth. At he Olympics he was very close to a medal but had to be content with a disappointing fourth place. He also missed winning the Diamond League by just a few hundredths of a second. Early 2017 he suffered an injury, but he returned just in time to run at the World Championships, and during the final he timed his run exactly right to become World Champion. In 2018 he took an early lead during the EC final and managed to win bronze. 
Johan Botha 
 Won a bronze medal at the 1998 Commonwealth Games. Had his best year in 1999 when he beat  to become World Indoor Champion. Reached the semifinals at the 1999 WC and 2000 Olympics. He was also second at the World Indoors in 2001. 
Peter Bourke 
 Won gold at the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. 
Donavan Brazier       
 Brazier caused headlines in 2016 when he suddenly improved his pb hugely  to 1:43.55 while winning the NCAA title when still only 19. His time improved the American junior record set 50 years earlier (to the day) by . He became US Champion in 2017 and competed regularly, performing well. His WC campaign was disappointing as he was eliminated in the semifinal. He started off very well in 2019 with an exceptional indoor 1.44.51, improving the American Indoor Record which was held for 27 years by . 
Peter Braun 
 Consistent runner, who participated frequently throughout the mid-eighties and was ranked in the top ten for several years. Had his best year in 1986 when he became European Indoor Champion. Also finished sixth at the European Championships later that year. 
Andre Bucher 
 Energetic front runner with great strength and speed. Lucky enough to be Swiss, which guaranteed him a starting place in Zurich from as early as 1995. At the 1998 EC he saw his steady progress rewarded with a silver medal. In 1999 he entered world class when he broke 1:43 and improved his PB by more than 1.5 seconds in Brussels. Ran very well in 2000 and was World leader (1:43.12) but only came 5th in the scrappy Olympic final. In 2001 he started well with a bronze at the European Indoors. During the 2001 outdoor season he was at the peak of his powers, clearly establishing himself as the king of the 800m after winning all duels except one with . He crowned his season by convincingly becoming World Champion in Edmonton and had possibly his finest moment running his PB in front of an ecstatic home crowd at the Weltklasse Zurich. From 2002 his results became less spectacular. At the European Indoors he was unexpectedly beaten into silver by . An injury spoiled his 2002 outdoor season preparation, but he still managed to take silver at the EC. Due to further injuries he never really reached world level again. His best was a  semifinal at the 2003 WC, at the 2004 Olympics and 2005 WC he went out in the heats. He hardly ran in 2006 and early in 2007 he announced his retirement. Apart from ,  and  he is still the only one to have gone below 1:43 three times within a single season (2001). 
Wilfred Bungei 
 Very talented Kenyan runner. Already 2nd at the 1998 WJ Championships. Reached world class in 2001 when he won silver at the WC. He also broke 1:43 later that season. In 2002 he ran  close in Rieti in the second fastest time of the year, which also made him 5th fastest athlete ever. Early in 2003 he became only the second Kenyan (after ) to break 1:45 indoors. At the World Indoors he won bronze. He was the number one during the 2003 outdoor season with several convincing wins well below 1:44, but unluckily missed the Kenyan trials due to illness. He had his revenge when he scored a splendid win in Brussels setting a world leading time of 1:42.52. In 2004 he won the Kenyan trials and the big races in Zurich and Brussels. His win in Zurich in 1:43.06 made him the 2004 world leader as well. He looked a favourite for Olympic gold but ran out of steam in the final and disappointingly came only 5th.  In 2005 he came first at the Kenyan trials, but at the World Championships he finished 4th after leading into the home straight. He did win at Zurich and at the World Finals and his win in Rieti (1:43.70) made him world leader for the third season in a row. Scored a long overdue first international title when he became 2006 indoor World Champion. Started well outdoor winning in Paris. Anchored the Kenyan relay team (with  ,  and ) to a new 4x800 WR (7:02.43) in Brussels. In 2007 he had a rather mediocre season. At the 2007 WC he did fairly well though and finished just a fraction short of a medal coming fifth. In 2008 he ran sparingly but he did win the Kenyan trials. In Beijing he grabbed his final chance at glory and crowned his career with a splendid win at the Olympic games. He effectively retired after that success.  Below 1:44 in each year from 2001-2006 (only  has a longer streak). Usually a front runner. In 2006 he became only the third athlete to run sub-1:45 for the 50th time. 
Mouhssin Chehibi
 Rose to international level in 2000 after reaching an Olympic semifinal and finishing 3rd at the African games. His usual tactics are to run last for the first 400 and only move to the front on the last 200. That strategy came good at the 2004 Olympics when he unexpectedly finished 4th. He reached the semis at the 2005 WC and set a new PB early in 2006. Reached the semis at the 2007 WC. 
Anthony Chemut       
 Another young Kenyan talent. Improved strongly in 2012 and qualified for the Olympics at the Kenyan trials. He finished second at the African Championships and reached the semifinals at the Olympics. Came first at the 2013 Kenyan trials, but at the World Championships he was unable to qualify for the final. Hasn't  performed at top level lately. 
Abraham Chepkirwok  
 In 2006 won bronze at the World Junior champs. In 2007 he won the GP race at Hengelo and improved his personal best several times. He made the WC final and  was very close to a medal before finishing fourth. Started quite promisingly in 2008, winning in Berlin. In Madrid he came second in a PB and broke 1:44 for the first and - as it turned out - the only time. At the Olympics he made  the semifinals. From 2009 onwards his performances dropped sharply. 
Ferguson Rotich Cheruiyot       
 Curiously changed his name after the Manchester United football coach. Inspired by  he took up running in 2013 after finishing his  studies and in his second race already ran 1:45. At the Kenyan trials he qualified for the World Championships where he reached the semifinals. Ran a spectacular PB in Brussels. In 2014 he ran another strong PB in Monaco breaking 1:43. In 2015 he won the Kenyan trials and at the World Championships he finished fourth. At the 2016 Olympics he made the final, finishing fifth. With a number of solid runs he also managed to win the Diamond League. That gave him the right to participate at the 2017 World Championships, where he reached the semifinals. In 2018 he won the Paris Diamond League race. 
Robert Chirchir 
 Regular competitor on the circuit in the late nineties, but due to the enormous depth in strength in Kenya he was never able to qualify for any major tournaments. Later occasionally a pacemaker. 
William Chirchir  
 Fine middle distance runner. Won the World Junior 800m title in 1998. Mostly switched to 1500m after 1999. At that distance he finished 8th at the 2000 Olympics and 4th at the 2001 World Championships. He remained a world class 1500m runner for several more years, but after 2005 his performances declined and he retired in 2007. 
Ocky Clark 
 Winner of the PanAm games in 1991. Held the American 1000m indoor record from 1989 until 2002 when it was broken by . 
Sebastian Coe 
 Legendary middle distance runner with an elegant style and incredible pace. Won his first international title at the 1977 European Indoor Championships when he outclassed the opposition despite being just 20 years old. Went out too fast at the 1978 EC but still managed bronze. Set a splendid world record of 1:42.33 in 1979, more than a second below 's mark. Within 6 weeks he also set WR's for 1500m and the mile. A world best on the 1000m (2:13.40) followed in 1980. He was beaten into silver at the Olympic 800m by  after a poor tactical race, but took revenge by taking gold at the 1500m. A new set of WR's followed in 1981, when he put the 800m mark at 1:41.73, a mark so good that it resisted attacks until 1997 when it was finally beaten by . A month later Coe clocked 2:12.18 for a 1000m WR that would remain intact even longer ( beat it in 1999). He took 's mile WR, lost it to him again and reclaimed it again that same season. Disappointingly he came only second at the 1982 EC. Early in 1983 he set the World Indoor record at 1:44.91i. At the 1984 Olympics he took silver on the 800m and another gold at 1500m. In 1986 he finally captured that elusive 800m title when he became European Champion in Stuttgart. 
Philippe Collard 
 Enjoyed a brief spell of success during the 1987 season. 
Steve Cram 
 Glorious middle distance runner mostly concentrating on the 1500m but with enough pace to gather 800m titles as well. In 1982 he became European Champion at 1500m, but was also world leader at 800m with a modest 1:44.45. In Helsinki 1983 he became the first 1500m World Champion. The following year he took silver at the Olympic 1500m. In 1985, at the peak of his career, he broke 's 1500m WR, beating  by 0.04 seconds and being the first ever athlete to run sub-3:30. Eleven days later he beat 's mile WR. Another eight days later he also ran a world best at 2000m. That same year his 2:12.88 at 1000m narrowly missed 's WR. In the Zurich 800m he finished ahead of , being the only one to beat him during 1984-5. In 1986 he was double CW Champion at 800m and 1500m. The following month he added an 800m bronze and a 1500m gold at the European Championships. He ended the year with the season's best mark of 1:43.19. In later years his sensitivity to injuries often prevented further top performances. 
Joaquim Cruz 
 One of the finest and most elegant athletes ever to run the 800m, as a young talent Cruz already set a world junior record in 1981 of 1:44.3m. He won a bronze medal at the WC in Helsinki 1983. At the 1984 Olympics he ran an amazing 1:43.82 to win his semifinal. The next day he beat World Record holder  into second place winning gold in a new Olympic record of 1:43.00, which also catapulted him into second place on the 800m all time list. Later that season he emphatically confirmed his status as the nr. 1 800m athlete of the moment. Terrific wins in Zurich, Brussels and Koln took 800m running to a level that remained unsurpassed for another 10 years, as he broke 1:43 all three times, and did so within a single week! In Koln he missed 's WR by as little as 0.04" as he set the (then) second fastest time ever of 1:41.77, making him one of only five athletes ever to break 1:42. He broke 1:43 a further three times (including the season's best of 1:42.49) in an almost equally splendid week in 1985.  After 1985 his career was hampered by injuries, but in 1988 he returned and won silver at the Seoul Olympics. In later years he switched to 1500m. He won the PanAm games in 1987 and 1995 on that distance.  His wonderful performances during the summers of 1984 and 1985 still keep him in third place on the all time top five average list, and he is also still the fifth fastest athlete ever. He still holds the South American record and until the 2016 Rio  Olympics no one had ran faster on South American soil. Very few athletes have ever ran six sub-1:43 marks: only  and  have more. 
Pawel Czapiewski 
 Won a totally unexpected bronze medal at the 2001 WC, improving his PB several times. He also managed to break the 16 year old Polish record going well below 1:44, even though he had never been below 1:45 before 2001. He outkicked  to become 2002 European Indoor Champion and finished 4th at the European Championships that same season. He hardly ran during 2003 and 2004 but returned in 2005 and although he could not get close to his earlier performances he still made the semis at the WC. After several low profile seasons he was back to international level in 2008. His standard tactics were to hang back for the first lap and produce an ultrafast sprint finish. 
Ralph Doubell 
 Improved himself by more than a second to win Olympic gold in 1968. The official time given was 1:44.3m, recognized as equalling the WR. This was later electronically corrected to 1:44.40. The mark stood as an Australian record for a stunning 50 years until it was finally beaten by Joseph Deng in 2018. 
Atle Douglas 
 Born in England, moved to Norway at age 16. Regular competitor during the early nineties. Finished 8th at the 1994 European Championships. 
Rob Druppers 
 Finished 5th as a young talent at the 1982 European Championships. In 1983 he kept improving and he won silver at the first ever World Championships. Made another European final in 1986 and came 4th. European Indoor Champion in 1987. Took two more silver medals at that event in 1988 and 1989. Holder of the Dutch record from 1982 until 2006. 
Glody Dube  
 Made the Olympic final in 2000 in a national record. In 2001 he enjoyed a relatively successful Grand Prix season. He came 8th in the 2002 CW final. He remained active for several more years but was unable to reach his former levels again. 
Peter Elliott 
 Middle distance runner with many successes, though often plagued by injuries. He took at a silver medal at the 1983 Indoor EC. Finished 4th at the WC in 1983. Won bronze at the 1986 CW games. A second medal at the 800m came in 1987 with a silver at the Rome WC. At the Seoul Olympics in 1988 he was 4th at the 800m but improved on that by taking a silver at the 1500m. Early in 1990 he won the 1500m at the CW Games. On the wings of that success he clocked the fastest 800m time of the 1990 season (1:42.97) a few weeks later. 
Paul Ereng 
 Didn't start running 800m until 1988. Became NCAA Champion and at the Kenyan trials qualified for the 1988 Olympic games in Seoul. Was considered as a total outsider but surprised everyone by producing a blistering finish to win Olympic gold. He went on to win the 1989 World Indoor title in a new world indoor record (1:44.84i). He totally dominated the 1989 season winning all but one of his races in great style. He reached the pinnacle of his career that year in Zurich where he convincingly beat the strongest field of the season with a splendid display of even pace running in what turned out to be the fastest time of the year (1:43.16) as well as of his career. He looked likely to win many more championships, but after 1989 his career inexplicably faltered. In 1991 he still won the World Indoor title and booked a 4th place at the WC, but those were his last notable performances. He was renowned for keeping an even pace throughout the race, often winning from behind. 
Mark Everett 
 Early success came in 1988 when he became US champion and qualified for the Olympic games. In the early 1990's he gradually became one of the leading athletes on the 800m. In 1991 he won several Grand Prix races and crowned his season with a bronze medal at the World Championships. He reached the 1992 Olympic final as well but could not finish after a fall. He managed to reach two more major finals, finishing 8th at the World Championships in both 1995 and 1997. His last notable performance came in 2000 when he became US champion for a record eighth time. He was well known for his 'wide' style of running and fast finishes. 
Moussa Fall 
 Reached the semifinals at the 1987 World Championships. 
Hans-Peter Ferner 
 Unexpectedly won the 1982 European Championship ahead of 'certain winner' . Also finished 7th at the 1983 WC. 
Marcello Fiasconaro 
 Born in South-Africa. A 400m/800m runner he won silver at 400m at the 1971 EC. Set the last manually timed World Record of 1.43.7m (still the Italian record). Came 6th at the 1974 EC. A foot injury forced him to retire early. 
Johnny Gray 
 Remarkable athlete showing unsurpassed consistency and durability. The only athlete to make four Olympic 800m finals, although just one medal resulted. Emerged from the 1984 US trials and finished 7th in the Olympics. Set a North American record in 1985 of 1:42.60 (still stands). In 1986 he also set a world best for 600m (1:12.81). Won the PanAm games in 1987. World leader in 1988 (1:42.65), when he also finished 5th in the Olympic final. He reached the 1991 WC final (finishing 6th). He set a North American indoor record in 1992 of 1:45.00 which stood for 27 years until it was finally broken by . World leader again in 1992 (1:42.80). Won his only major international medal (a bronze) that same year at the Barcelona Olympics at age 32. He reached yet another Olympic final in 1996, finishing 7th. Won the PanAm games in 1999 aged 39. Six times US champion between 1985 and 1996.  Although he didn't win many global medals Gray was extremely consistent for  many years. His total of 65 sub 1:45-runs was eventually surpassed by  , and also by ,  but no other athlete has approached 60. He went below 1:44 no less than 26 times (Kipketer and Rudisha have more, but no one else has reached 20). He also broke 1:45 a stunning 14 consecutive seasons (second best is 11 by ). He is still holder of all age records from 35-39 years. 
Trinity Gray  
 Fastest American in 2000 and 2001 seasons, but was never able to qualify for a major Championship. Retired only a few seasons later. 
Agberto Guimaraes 
 One of the top runners in the earlier and mid-eighties. Came 4th at 1980 Olympics, 6th at the WC in 1983. He won gold at both 800 and 1500 at the 1983 Pan American games In 1984 and 1985 he ran a string of excellent sub-1:44 times in races dominated by compatriot . 
Mahjoub Haida 
 Regular competitor in the middle and late nineties. Reached the semifinals of the 1993 and 1995 WC. Came second at the 1997 World Indoor Championships. Held the Moroccan record from 1995 to 2006 when it was broken by . 
Arthemon Hatungimana 
 African Champion in 1995, took silver that same year at the World Championships. He had a very good season in 1996, but unluckily just missed the Olympic final as the fastest non-qualifier. He ran only briefly but well late in 1997, and a long and successful career looked very possible. Over the next three years however his levels dropped dramatically and he could not even break 1:45 once. In 2001 he suddenly peaked again and even improved his PB. After that single successful season he mysteriously disappeared again. 
Rene Herms 
 Talented German runner who became European U20 champion in 2001 and U23 champion in 2003. In 2002 he finished 7th at the European Championships. He set his PB just before the 2004 Olympics and went on to reach the Olympic semifinals. Although he was German Champion from 2001 to 2006 an international breakthrough never quite happened. Early in 2009 he was totally unexpectedly found dead in his apartment, having suffered a heart attack caused by inflamed heart muscle due to a viral infection. 
Ismail Ahmed Ismail  
 Tall athlete (1.91) whose length and giant strides often make him stand out in the field. He already ran 1:46 when only 18 and did surprisingly well at the 2004 Olympic Games where he made the final even if he could only finish 8th. In 2006 he ran 1:44 and came 2nd in the African Championships. He hardly ran in 2007 but did really wel in 2008 breaking his PB several times and doing well in several Grand Prix races. He then crowned an already excellent season with a silver medal at the Olympic games. In 2009 he had a great indoor season, breaking 1"45 and becoming the fourth fastest athlete alltime indoors. Outdoors he ran strongly as well running a new PB in Athens, breaking 1"44. He also managed a win in Paris. At the WC he dropped out of his semifinal. After that splendid season the next years were very disappointing. In 2010 he hardly ran any major races. At the 2011 WC he  came last in his heat and in 2012 he was off the pace during his Olympic heat. 
Joeri Jansen 
 Regular competitor at the highest level for several years, but unable to break through and reach a major final. In 2005 he switched to the 1500m. His PB also holds the unusual distinction of being the fastest time ever run by an athlete finishing in 10th place only. 
Lee Jin-Il 
 Holder of the Asian record until 2004 when it was broken by . Still the fastest native Asian of all time. Suspended from 1995-1997 for a doping offence. 
Brandon Johnson       
 Originally a runner at the shorter 400m and 400m hurdles, but after a year without sponsorship in 2009 he quit athletics in 2010 and 2011. Started running the 800m for fun in 2012 and with so much success that he broke 1:44 in 2013 and made the World  Championships, where he missed qualifying for the final by just 0.04 seconds. 
Earl Jones 
 Unexpectedly won the 1984 US trials in a world class time, then confirmed his talent by winning an Olympic bronze. Another string of good results followed in 1986 but a serious injury forced him to end his career prematurely. 
Alberto Juantorena 
 Actually a 400meter runner Juantorena apparently decided just weeks before the 1976 Olympics to participate in the 800m as well. He gloriously emerged with gold in both events setting a new 800m world record (1:43.50) in the process. The following year he improved his world record to 1:43.44 in Sofia. After 1978 injuries forced him to specialize in the 400meter again (4th in the 1980 Olympics). Known for his majestic long strides he was nicknamed El Caballo (the horse). 
Abubaker Kaki       
 One of the strongest runners between 2007 and 2012. Winner of the Pan-Arab games late in  2007 in a stunning 1:43. Early in 2008 he became the youngest ever World Indoor Champion, leading the fast final from start to finish. In Oslo he ran out a brilliant winner in a new world Junior Record (1:42.69), breaking the old mark by , and becoming the first one to break 1:43 for almost five years. Later that season he became World Junior Champion. He looked a serious contender for the Olympic title but inexplicably failed in the semis. Started impressively in 2009 winning two very fast races in Doha and Hengelo but dropped out dramatically in Oslo. At the WC his bad luck at major tournaments continued as he fell over during his semifinal. In 2010 he front ran the final to retain his World Indoor title. In a spectacular run in Oslo he was just beaten by  but still ran a brilliant new PB to move him up to fifth on the alltime list. He won the Paris Diamond League meeting and also came first in the fast Monaco race and in London. In the first Diamond League season he finished second. In 2011 he ran very well although in his fastest race, in London, he came second to  again. At the World Championships he won a silver medal. Started 2012 with a win in Eugene but his form declined during the season. At the Olympic games he tried to go with   for too long and ended up in seventh place. Injured in 2013 but returned in 2014, although his results were inconsistent. Does not appear to have run from 2015 onwards. 
Youssef Saad Kamel 
 Born as Gregory Konchellah, son of former Kenyan World Champion . In 2003 he showed early promise when he ran 1:45. In November 2003 he changed nationality to Bahrain and changed his name into Youssef Saad Kamel. His real breakthrough came in 2004 when he ran several solid races before winning the fastest ever B-race in Zurich in a stunning new Asian record. At the Olympics an illness caused him to be eliminated in the heats, but he ended the season well with victories in Berlin and at the World finals. In 2005 he did well but was unable to win any major races and at the WC he just missed the final.  In 2006 he had another steady season and was victorious at the World Cup. Made a promising start in 2007 but again just missed the WC final. Took a bronze medal at the 2008 World Indoor Championships. In Monaco he ran an excellent new Asian record breaking 1:43 for the first time. At the Olympic games he fell just short of a medal and came fifth. In 2009 he concentrated on the 1500 and with great success as he became World Champion. Four days later he also took bronze at the 800. Injuries spoiled 2010 and most of 2011, and at the 2011 WC he was unable to defend his world title as he just failed to reach the 1500m final. He rarely ran after 2011. 
Rich Kenah 
 Rose to fame in 1997 finishing 3rd in the World Indoor championships, then 3rd in the US trials, and finally winning a bronze at the WC when he just outsprinted .  He set a very promising PB in Zurich, but shortly after that he was plagued by injuries, which forced him to announce his retirement. 
George Kersh 
 Regular competitor and among the top US runners in the early nineties. He ran his PB at the 1992 US trials, but agonisingly only finished 4th by just a few hundredths. 
Robert Kibet 
 Caused quite a shock in 1989 when he debuted on the European scene with 1:43.70 in Oslo, but somehow other big results never materialized. Finished 2nd at the 1990 African Championships and the 1991 All-Africa games. In later years he regularly competed at international meetings but his performances were less spectacular. He improved his PB late in 1996 but it proved to be his last race below  1:45. Paced El Guerrouj through the first 800m of his 1998 1500m WR of 3:26.00. 
Philip Kibitok  
 Quickly rose to international level in 1995. He made the semifinal in the 1995 WC, and again at the 1996 Olympics. He won the Kenyan Championships in 1996 in 1:43.80, which remained the fastest time on Kenyan soil for seven years. After 1996 his short career faded quickly and he was never able to break 1:45 again. 
Japheth Kimutai 
 A prodigious talent Kimutai won a World Junior title in 1996, then set a world junior record of 1.43.64 in the 1997 Zurich B-race which stood for 11 years until it was broken (by  in 2008). He was generally considered to be the leading 800m runner of 1998, as he broke 1:43 twice, beat  in the season's second fastest race in Zurich, and topped the 1998 list in 1:42.76. He finished off with gold at the African Championships and the CW games. The following year he performed on a similarly high level, breaking 1:43 two more times, but was unable to match 's magnificent return to form. He finished out of the medals (5th) at the WC, but was still victorious at the All-Africa Games. He looked set for many glorious years but unfortunately his performances dropped sharply after 2000. At the 2002 CW games he came 5th. He showed a brief return to form towards the end of 2002 and made a promising start to 2003, in particular when he won the Kenyan trials in the fastest time ever run on African soil (a mark since broken by  in 2010). At the WC he was eliminated in the semifinals. After a poor 2004 season his career effectively ended. 
Kennedy Kimwetich 
 Burst onto the scene in 1998 with an astonishing PB of 1:43.03, but was unable to repeat that kind of performance. In the CW final he lead at 400 in sub-WR pace but eventually came only last. He had his best season in 1999 when he ran a number of solid races and reached the WC final finishing 7th. 
Wycliffe Kinyamal       
 First noticed when he ran a 1:45 PB during the 2017 Hengelo games, but even more so when he set a huge PB of 1:43.94 in Rovereto towards the end of the seson. In 2018 he showed his real talent when he won gold at the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast. A few months later he improved his PB winning at the Shanghai Diamond League meeting. He also won in Rome. In the very fast London race he came third but strongly improved his PB  
Job Koech Kinyor       
 Strong Kenyan middle distance runner, son of Barnabas Kinyor, a retired 400m hurdler who has a PB at 800m just below 1:45.  Early in 2012 he ran a spectacular PB and also ran strongly in Hengelo and London. In 2013 he won the Kenyan Championships. He ran the 3rd leg during Kenya's winning 4x800 relay race at the 2014 inaugural World Relay Championships in Nassau. He ran several fast races in 2015 but was unable to qualify for the World Championships.  
Alfred Kipketer       
 In 2013 this talented runner became World Youth Champion. He also ran the 4th leg during Kenya's winning 4x800 relay race at the inaugural World Relay Championships in Nassau.  Later that year he lead the World Junior Championship final from start to finish and took  gold in a strong new PB while still only 17 years old. In 2015 he ran frequently on the  Diamond League circuit, but only rarely finished close to the leaders. He finished third at the Kenyan trials and made the WC final, but only finished in eighth place. In the 2016 he made the Olympic final but started way too fast and only came seventh.  Two weeks later he won the Paris Diamond League meeting in a terrific new PB.  He hardly ran in 2017. In 2018 he made a comeback. 
Wilson Kipketer 
 Former World Record holder and triple World Champion, universally recognized as one of the greatest 800m runners ever, renowned for his marvellously elegant running style. Was born in Kenya, but moved to Denmark in 1990. He leapt to international fame when he convincingly won the very fast 800m race at the 1994 Bislett Games. He went on to win all but one of the Grand Prix races he took part in that season. In 1995 he remained unbeaten, set a seasons best of 1:42.87, broke 1:43 twice and became World Champion representing Denmark. In 1996 he did even better, as he again won all his races (including all of the Golden Four), broke 1:43 an amazing seven times, and clocked 1:41.83 at Rieti, the fastest mark for 12 years. Due to an archaic 'seven year rule' regarding naturalization his Olympic participation was blocked and he was denied a chance to go for an almost certain Olympic gold.  At the 1997 World Indoor Championships his efforts were superhuman as he smashed 's World Indoor Record by almost a full second (1:43.96i) during the heats, won his semi the following day at leisure, then demolished his own mark the next day in the final in 1:42.67i, a time few had believed possible on an indoor track with its much tighter bends. His outdoor season took on epic proportions as well, as he first equalled 's WR in Stockholm (1:41.73), broke it in Zurich (1:41.24) and lowered it again to 1:41.11 in Koln, a mark that stood for 13 years until it was beaten by the astounding . Inbetween he defended his World Title in Athens. He remained unbeaten for the third consecutive season, went below 1:43 seven more times, and was overall Grand Prix winner as well.  His superb domination was unfortunately broken by a severe attack of malaria in early 1998. Although he did run several races he was beaten, for the first time in four years, in Zurich by , and was unable to do himself justice during the physical final of the European Championships. At the 1999 World Indoor Championships he finished second to , but the outdoor season saw him back to his glorious best, as he won all seven Golden League races, as well as the overall Grand Prix. Although he couldn't quite reach the dizzying levels of 1997 he remained unbeaten, broke 1:43 three times and posted the fastest time of the year in Brussels with 1:42.27. He also won the World Championship title again, his third in a row, although he had to beat  in a very close finish.  During the 2000 indoor season he broke the 1000m World Indoor record twice, first in Stuttgart (2:15.25i), then again in Birmingham (2:14.96i). The record stood for 16 years until it was broken by . An injury spoiled his outdoor season though, and he raced just a few times before going to the Olympics, where he left his kick just too late to overtake  and had to be content with the silver medal. Injuries forced him to miss the entire 2001 season. In 2002 he was almost back to his old level again. He won all but one of his races ( beat him in Zurich), became European Champion, broke 1:43 twice and topped the season's list with 1:42.32. Early in 2003 he finished 2nd at the Indoor WC. His form in 2003 was rather indifferent and in the World Championships final he finished 4th. Although he appeared no longer invincible he still opened his 2004 season promisingly with a win in Rome. At the Olympics he came close to his only missing title but in the end  proved too strong and he had to settle for bronze. He ended the season with what would turn out to be his last race in Rieti. In 2005 he announced his retirement.  Although he never won Olympic gold he is the only one who ever won the World  Championship gold three times. Apart from his official World Records (he still holds the 800m indoor record) he also still has a large number of unofficial records: most sub-1:45 marks (75), most sub-1:44 marks (45, still ahead of ), most sub-1:43 marks (22, also still well ahead of Rudisha). He ran the most sub-1:45 marks in a single season (12 in 1996, 13 including two indoor marks in 1997). As of 2018 he still holds 8 of the 25 best marks ever, and 22 of the top 100. 
Nicholas Kiplangat Kipkoech       
 Kenyan runner who lept to the fore in 2016. He took part in the 2009 World Youth Cahmpionships (finishing third) and in 2012 he improved to 1:45.01 but otherwise stayed largely below the radar. In 2016 however he won the Kenyan Defence Championships in a stunning 1:43.37. He also became  Kenyan Champion a month later, again running 1:43. Disappointingly he failed to qualify from the  Kenyan Olympic trials. In 2017 he couldn't reach the levels of the year before. 
John Kipkurgat 
 Impressive winner of the 1974 Commonwealth Games in what was then the second fastest time ever. 
Benjamin Kipkurui  
 Won a silver medal at 1500m at the World Junior Championships in 1998. That same year in Leverkusen he became the youngest athlete ever to break 1:45 (1:44.71 aged 17y 8m). Mostly a 1500m runner. In that event he was ranked among the top ten for several years. 
Abraham Kiplagat  
 Appeared from nowhere in 2010 and ran an amazing PB in Monaco in his first race at world class level. At the Commonwealth games he won a bronze medal. 
Asbel Kiprop       
 Very tall athlete (1.86m). In 2007 he already showed his talent winning the World Cross  Country title in his age group and also winning gold at the All Africa Games 1500m. That same year he finished fourth at the WC 1500m. The next year he came third at the African Championships at 800m and finished second in the 2008 Olympic 1500m final when only 19, but was awarded the gold when  was later disqualified. Set a big  PB at 800m early in 2009 and also won a very fast race in Athens. Was a main favourite for a WC title but only came fourth at the 1500m and was eliminated in the semis at 800m. Finished second in a fast time in the first Diamond League meeting in 2010. Later that year he became African Champion at 1500m. Started 2011 with a win in the Diamond League and ran a new PB in Monaco. At the WC he won a gold medal at the 1500m. In 2012 he was already injured when he started the Olympic 1500m final and could only come last. In 2013 he concentrated on the 1500m  and became World Champion once more. In 2014 in a  rare return to the 800m he showed his exceptional talent winning a fast race in Paris in a new World Leading mark. Later that year he ran the second fastest 1500m in history and also became World Champion at the 1500m again. In 2018 a positive doping sample from him was reported. 
Nixon Kiprotich 
 Front runner who appeared on the scene in 1988. Qualified for the Olympic final but went out much too fast and finished last. He became African Champion in 1989 and did well on the European circuit, although he was not quite able to match  at his finest hour. At the 1990 CW he won a silver medal. In 1992 he enjoyed his best season winning a number of Grand Prix races and also winning the overall circuit, although he had to settle for silver behind  at the Barcelona Olympic Games. In 1993 he crowned yet another fine season with a world leading mark of 1:43.54. In 1994 he had a rather indifferent season and he retired soon afterwards. 
Wilson Kiprugut 
 First Kenyan distance runner to make an international impact. Won Kenya's first ever Olympic medal (bronze) in 1964. In 1966 he took silver at the CW games (at 880y). Front running most of the race he was narrowly beaten into silver at the 1968 Olympic games. 
David Kiptoo 
 Appeared on the circuit in 1994 when already in his late twenties (although year of birth was originally given as 1967). Finished 6th in the 1996 Olympic final. Went sub-1:45 eleven times during 1996 season (only  has ever done better). Remained one of the most regular competitors during the late nineties. Paced the race in Koln (400m in 49.00) when  set his 1:41.11 WR. Remained active as pacemaker during his late thirties. 
Jonathan Kitilit       
 Young Kenyan runner who made tremendous progress in 2016. As early as March he ran a new PB of 1:44.7 (then the fastest time of the season), but quickly improved to 1:43.48 in April.  He came sixth at the Kenyan Olympic trials, but in Paris he set another PB of 1:43.05. Did not run in 2017. In 2018 he won the Kenyan CW Games Trials and came 6th at the CW games. He also won in a fast time in Hengelo and was even faster winning the Kenyan Championships. He came second in Birmingham in another 1:43, becoming only the sixth athlete to break 1:44 at least six times in a single season. 
Timothy Kitum       
 This Kenyan talent first made his name when he finished 3rd at the 2011 World Youth Championships. In 2012 he improved his PB by almost a second. At the Kenyan trials he qualified for the Olympic games. Won silver at the World Junior Championshiups. At the Olympics he won a fantastic bronze medal in a big PB. His 2013 season was steady but not great. In 2014 he won at Heusden but had otherwise another pale season. From 2015 onwards his results never made the headlines. 
Jackson Mumbwa Kivuva       
 Kenyan talent who won silver medals both at the 2005 World Youth and 2006 World Junior Championships. He qualified for the 2009 WC and reached the final finishing 9th. In 2010 he ran regularly and set a strong PB in Monaco. At the African Games he won bronze. Qualified for the 2011 WC but went out in the semifinals. Ran only sporadically after 2012. 
Benson Koech 
 World Junior Champion in 1992 breaking 1:45 in the process. In 1994 he unexpectedly won at Rieti in the season's top mark of 1:43.17. Finished second at the 1995 World Indoor Championships. From 1996 on he was mostly active at 1500m. 
Justus Koech 
 Came second in the 2003 Kenyan trials. He could not quite convince on the Grand Prix circuit, but did make the World Championships final, finishing sixth. Showed good early form in 2004 but failed to qualify for the Olympics. His next two seasons were rather disappointing. He did better in 2007 and reached the semifinals at the WC. Was hardly seen after that though. 
Marko Koers  
 Successful on the American circuit winning the 1993 and 1996 NCAA titles. Finished sixth at the 1997 WC in his best year on the 800m. Won silver at the 1998 European Indoor Champs. Thereafter he concentrated his career on the 1500m. 
Ismael Kombich 
 Became Kenyan champion from nowhere in 2006. Also ran the third leg when the Kenyan relay team (with ,  and ) set a new 4x800 WR (7:02.43) in Brussels. In 2007 and 2008 he only ran a few major races and never recorded any further notable results. 
Billy Konchellah 
 Set the pace (400 in 49.6) for 's 1981 World Record. Finished 4th at the 1984 Olympics. Dominated the 1987 season, when he won four big meetings in succession, became World Champion in the fastest time of the year and also won the African Championships. Illnesses (asthma, TB) kept him out of competition for several years. He unexpectedly returned in 1991 to defend his WC title successfully with a spectacularly fast finish. In 1993 he had another brief return and almost won a third world title but had to settle for bronze. His son  turned out to be a great talent as well. 
Gregory Konchellah  
 Son of former World Champion . In November 2003 he switched nationality to Bahrain and changed his name into . 
Patrick Konchellah 
 Came out of the shadow of older brother  in 1994 when he became Kenyan champion. He beat  in Brussels and ended the year with gold at the CW games. Two lean years followed but he returned for an excellent season in 1997 when he became Kenyan Champion again and came 4th at the 1997 WC, losing a medal place only by inches to . He came second in Koln in 's WR race in a 1:42.98 PB, ironically just below that of his more successful brother. In 2000 he won the Kenyan Championships a third time. 
Emmanuel Korir       
 Very promising young runner that burst on the scene in 2017 after  became his trainer. He won the NCAA Indoor title, ran a World Indoor best on 600m and added the NCAA Outdoor title in 1:43.73 the second fastest time ever run at the event. In May he ran a  400m in an astoundingly fast 44.53. He won the Kenyan trials and set a new PB in Monaco, running a low 1:43 and awinning the race with a huge lead. At the World Championships though he suffered a shock exit from his semifinal. Early in 2018 he won a very fast indoor race, making him 3rd fastest indoor of all time. His next elite 800m race was in London where he destroyed the field in an amazing 1:42.05, making him the sixth fastest athlete of all time. It was also the fastest time  since the 2012 Olympic race was run on that same track. He had yet another fast victory in Birmingham. He concluded his fantastic season by winning the Diamond League final.  
Leonard Kirwa Kosencha       
 Started out as a young bright Kenyan talent. At the 2011 World Youth Championships he ran  a sensational World Youth best. Started 2012 well with a strong race in Daegu, then improved his PB in Rabat, won in Rome and further improved in Monaco. He did not however manage to qualify for the Olympics and had a poor season in 2013. Seems to have virtually retired since. Curiously he comes from the same village as . 
Sammy Koskei 
 Still number six on the all time list. In 1984 he became African Champion and ran brilliantly to finish a close second in Koln (when  just missed the WR) and to destroy the African record by well over a second. He also came 2nd in two other major races. Several good performances followed in 1985, including a second African title, but in later years successes became rare. Remarkably he never managed to qualify for major global championships. His 1:42.28 remained the African record for 25 years until it was finally bettered in 2009 by  and is still the second best ever time for an athlete finishing 2nd. 
David Krummenacker 
 Three times US champion (2001-2003). Improved steadily for many years. In 2001 he reached the WC semifinal but was not quite ready for the top yet. In 2002 he set a new US Indoor record at 1000m. During the outdoor season he was very competitive, improved his PB, and on two occassions broke 1:44 (the first American to do so since 1997). He got 2003 off to a perfect start when he beat  to become World Indoor Champion, but at the outdoor WC he was unable to get past the semis. His 2004 season was disappointing and he only finished 4th at the US Olympic trials. In 2005 he reached the WC semifinals for a third time. His levels slipped after that  but for several years he remained active as pacemaker. 
Adam Kszczot       
 Polish runner who has won many titles and medals. Made his first internaional impression in 2010 with a bronze at the World Indoor Championships. He enjoyed a promising outdoor season and at the European Championships later that year he took another bronze. Early in 2011 he became European Indoor Champion. Outdoors he managed to improve his PB below 1:45. At the WC he made the final and finished sixth. In Rieti he improved his PB by exactly a second. His 2012 indoor season was very impressive and he scored a splendid win in Lievin   improving his indoor PB so strongly that he moved up to nr 3 on the all time indoor list. Outdoors he won the Diamond League race in London. At the Olympics he was eliminated in the semifinals. In 2013 he became European Indoor Champion for the second time. At the 2013  World Championships he also reached the semis. In 2014 he took a silver medal on his home soil at the World Indoor Championships. At the European Champs he produced a fabulous final dash and won an emphatic gold medal. In 2015 he started well and in Monaco he ran his second fastest time ever. At the World Championships he scored his first global outdoor success as he took silver. His last weeks of the 2015 season were marvellous, winning in Zurich (ahead of ), finishing second in Berlin (behind  ) and winning again in Brussels (this time ahead of Amos) and Rieti.  In 2016 he very convincingly won his second European outdoor title. At the Olympics though he unluckily and unexpectedly ended up being the fastest ever non-qualifier for the  final. He had a minor revenge winning the Diamond League final. He started well in 2017 by winning his third European Indoor title. His outdoor season was indifferent, but at the World  Championships he did well, taking another silver after leaving his kick just too late.  His 2018 indoor season was very impressive with eight victories in eight races. The last one of those was at the World Indoor Championships, giving him his first global gold to go with the five European golds (three indoor, two outdoor) he had already. Later that year he won his third consecutive European title beating the opposition convincingly and also becoming the first athlete ever to win three outdoor European 800m titles. 
Amine Laalou 
 Made his first international appearances in 2002 and improved markedly in 2003. Scored a string of good results in 2004 and crowned it with a sub 1:44 PB in the Zurich B-race. He reached the semifinals at the Olympic games. Apart from a single race his form in 2005 was disappointing. A victory in a big PB in Rome 2006 put him back on world level and he had a number of other strong races that season. In 2007 he had another indifferent season - an excellent race in Monaco was mixed with lesser results. He did make the WC final though, finishing sixth. In 2008 his best was a fine win in Rome. At the Olympics he reached the semifinals. In 2009 he started off with his second fastest run and at the WC he made the final at the 1500 and again at the 800metres, finishing fifth. In 2010 he mostly switched to 1500m but also ran two very fast 800m marks. At the 2011 WC he only ran the 1500m but disappointingly failed to qualify for the final. In 2012 he was suspended for two  years for a doping offence. 
Florent Lacasse 
 Broke 1:48 when only 18 years old, and steadily improved the following years. Early in 2003 he impressively broke his own PB by over a second. He reached the semifinals at the 2003 WC. A major breakthrough looked imminent but never happened. In 2004 he could not get past the heats at the Olympic games. In 2006 he looked ready for a medal at the EC but could only finish sixth. Was suspended for two years after a doping violation in 2007. 
Benyounes Lahlou 
 Originally a 400m runner Lahlou switched to 800m relatively late (1995) to enjoy a successful if short career on that distance. His best year was 1996 when he convincingly won his Olympic semifinal and finished 8th in the final. 
Boaz Kiplagat Lalang  
 Young Kenyan runner who stepped forward in 2008 improving to 1:44 and made the semis at the Olympic games. Early in 2010 he took silver at the World Indoor Champs. Outdoors he was the second pacemaker when  ran 1:41.51 in Heusden.  In Monaco he ran an excellent PB, which he improved even further in Rieti during   world record race, breaking 1:43 as well.  In Delhi at the Commonwealth Games he won a gold medal. In 2011 he showed solid form but was unable to qualify for the World Championships. His 2012 season was disappointing and he failed to qualify for the Olympics. 
Sammy Langat 
 African Champion in 1993. He was one of the most consistent runners from 1994-1996, but was unable to force selection to any major championships. He had a particularly successful year in 1996 when he broke 1:45 an impressive nine times, three of which went below 1:44 as well. He set his PB winning what was then the fastest ever B-race (Zurich). He didn't run in 1997 and never broke 1:45 from then on. Occasionally ran as pacemaker in later years. 
Otukile Lekote  
 Did well in 2001 in the American College competition. Finished 4th in the 2002 Commonwealth Games, but disappeared into obscurity soon after that. 
David Lelei 
 In the late nineties mostly a strong 1500m runner, finishng 2nd at the African Games and making the WC final in 1999. Early in 2000 he had a number of successful 800m races. His PB on 800 stood for ten years as the fastest 800m mark run on Australian soil. In 2001 he came 4th at the World Indoors. In later years he often ran as pacemaker. In 2010 he was tragically killed in a car accident. 
Marcin Lewandowski       
 Talented Polish runner. Made significant progress in 2009 when he came 2nd at the EC U23 and improved his PB by over a second. At the WC he was tripped during the semis and reinstated into the final, finishing 8th. Showed fine early form in 2010 and proved his tactical ability at the European Championships, taking gold. Also won the Stockholm Diamond League race during his successful 2010 season. At the 2011 European Indoors he took silver. Later that year he made the final at the World Championships and came fourth. Raced sparingly in 2012 saving himself for the Olympic Games but went out in the semis. In 2013 his season started off slowly but he peaked towards the World Championships and in the fast final he finished fourth once more. Later that season he improved his PB in Zurich. Early in 2014 he was unlucky at the Indoor World Championships where he finished third only to be disqualified for stepping inside the track. At the EC he made the final, finishing fifth. In 2015 he shaved 0.07 seconds from his PB. At the World Championships he made the semifinals. In 2016 he took silver at the European Championships and came sixth in the Olympic final. In 2017 he was eliminated during the semis of the WC. 
Andrea Longo 
 Tall and strong front runner. Was european champion under 23 in 1997. Made his international breakthrough in 1998 breaking 1:44 and finishing 7th at the EC. In 1999 he maintained his level and came 6th at the WC. In 2000 he narrowly missed the Italian record. He made the 2000 Olympic final and finished 6th but was disqualified for pushing. In 2001 he was suspended for two years after a nandrolone offence. He managed to qualify just in time for the 2003 World Championships and finished fifth. In 2004 he reached the Olympic semifinals. His 2005 season was unconvincing, but in 2006 he reached his last final at the European Championships (7th). 
Kevin Lopez       
 Became European Junior Champion in 2009 and made the final at the 2010 European Champs, finishing 6th. Early in 2011 he took bronze at the European Indoor Champs. In 2011 he improved enormously, broke 1:45 for the first time and reached the semis at the World  Championships. In 2012 he broke 1:44 and also set a new Spanish record at Monaco. At the Olympics he made the semifinals. In 2013, 2015 and 2017 he reached the semis at the  World Champs. 
Yeimer Lopez  
 Started out as a 400m runner (PB 45.11 in 2003) but succesfully switched to 800. Scored his first major win at the 2007 PanAm Games where he broke 1:45 for the first time as well. In 2008 he ran a stunningly fast PB in Jerez and also won in Athens. Made the Olympic final where he looked strong but lacked strength in the final straight and finished sixth. In 2009 at the WC a convincing semifinal run was again followed by a disappointing tenth place in the final. The next four years his career appeared to be fading, but in early 2014 he ran  his second,third and fourth fastest races ever. 
David Mack 
 Among the top US runners of the early eighties. Reached the semifinals of the 1983 World Championships. He often performed well in European meetings but was unable to make the US team in later years. 
James Maina 
 Winner of the All-Africa games in 1978. His best year was 1979 when he became African champion and scored a good win in Zurich. He had another fine season in 1982 winning silver medals at both the African Games and the Commonwealth Games. 
Taoufik Makhloufi       
 Originally a 1500m runner, made the semis at the WC in 2009 and again in 2011. His breakthrough came at the All-Africa Games when he won the 800m and came third at the 1500m. In 2012  he became African Champion at 800m, improving his PB dramatically. At the Olympic Games  he impressed at the 1500m outclassing the field with a tremendous sprint finish for Olympic gold.  In 2014 he took bronze at the African Champs, ran a new PB in Berlin and won in Rieti. In 2016 he took a fantastic Olympic silver in a very fast new National Record (and added a silver at the 1500 as well). In Paris he recorded yet another sub 1:43 race, finishing second. In 2017 he didn't run due to injury. 
Vincent Malakwen 
 Appeared on the circuit in 1995 as another young Kenyan talent. African champion that same year on 1500m, and second on the 800m, but other major successes never materialized. Often a pacemaker in later years. 
Jose Marajo 
 Finished 7th at the 1980 Olympics. Held the French national record for 23 years. 
John Marshall 
 Finished 3rd at the legendary 800m run at the 1984 US 800m trials, but was unable to make it through to the Olympic final. 
Brandon McBride       
 Young athlete who in 2012 came sixth at the World Junior Championships in a new National  Junior Record (1:46.07). He really improved in 2016, breaking 1:45 four times before breaking 1:44 as well. At the Olympics he reached the semis. At the 2017 WC he made the final finishing eighth. In 2018 he came second in the very fast Monaco race and improved not just his own PB but also the ten year old Canadian record by /. 
Tom McKean 
 Effectively the last of the golden generation of British middle distance runners. Made an impressive entrance into the international scene when finishing 2nd at the 1986 CW games. Earned another silver medal four weeks later at the EC. Reached the WC final in 1987. The only man to beat  during the 1989 season. Very successful in 1990 when he took the European Indoor title and later that year added the European Championship leading the race from start to finish. In 1993 he scored his final triumph becoming World Indoor Champion. 
Edwin Kiplagat Melly       
 Yet another young Kenyan talent. At the 2012 World Junior Championships he came third  breaking 1:45 for the first time. Later that year he improved his PB twice more, clocking his first 1:43 in his last race as well. His 2013 season was a bit disappointing as his best run came only in the last race of the season in Rieti. Has virtually disappeared from the scene since. 
Dmitrijs Milkevics  
 Latvian runner who spent most of his career in the USA. In 2004 he made huge progress and got to the Olympic semis. In 2005 he became NCAA champion. In 2006 he broke the Latvian record and improved himself by almost a second. At the European Champs he finished 4th after leading most of the race. His 2007 season was rather disappointing and at the WC he went out in the semis. A fourth place at the 2008 World Indoor Championships was his last notable result. 
Noureddine Morceli 
 Exceptional 1500m runner who totally dominated the distance from 1990-1996. World Champion in 1991, 1993, 1995, Olympic Champion in 1996. Set World records on four distances: 1500m (1992 and 1995), mile (1993), 2000m (1995) and 3000m (1994). He held all four World Records from 1995-1996. Occasionally ran 800m races as well, but never in major tournaments. 
Nico Motchebon 
 Former double modern pentathlon national champion who made a successful switch to athletics after 1992. His quick progress showed early in 1993 when he already notched up a bronze medal at the 1993 European Indoor Championships. At the 1994 European Championships he finished 4th. Early in 1995 he set a splendid European Indoor record of 1:44.88i. Later that year he finished 4th at the World Championships. Set his PB in the 1996 Olympic final finishing 5th. In 1999 he showed his indoor talents once more when he won another bronze at the World Indoor Championships. 
Mbulaeni Mulaudzi 
 One of the greatest ever 800m runners, with a very consistent career spanning ten years. He won many major medals, his best the World Championship gold in 2009.  His international career really started in 2001 when he lowered his PB by more than 1.5 seconds and came 6th in the WC final. In 2002 he broke 1:44 and won gold at the CW games. He had an excellent season in 2003 when he won several Grand Prix meetings, including Zurich, where he beat the entire world elite. At the World Championships he won a bronze medal with a final dash for the line. In Brussels he also broke 1:43 for the first time, finishing second. Early in 2004 he convincingly became World Indoor Champion. His outdoor season was rather mediocre but he still scored a silver medal at the Olympics.   In 2005 he started very well, running consistently fast and winning a close race in Oslo, but suffered a shock elimination in the WC semifinal. In 2006 he won a silver medal at the World Indoor Championships. His outdoor season was excellent as well with wins in Zurich, Berlin and the World Athletics Final and he became World Leader in Rieti. A win in Monaco made him 2007 World Leader as well. He looked a major favourite for the 2007 World championships but finished only 7th. He finished a close second to  in the fast 2008 World Indoor Championship final. Outdoors he ran well, breaking 1:44 three times. At the Olympics he did not get past the semifinals. In 2009 he fell ill and had early injuries, but at the WC, after qualifying for the final as a fast loser, he timed his run to perfection to become World Champion. Later that season he couldn't win any major races but did run a new PB in Rieti. In 2010 he was in excellent form and would have won several races but for the extreme speed of the young talents  and . An injury prevented him in 2011 from defending his world title and he hardly ran  after that although he only retired officially two years later. One year later he tragically died in a traffic accident. 
Clayton Murphy       
 Jumped to world class in the 2016 Olympic final when he took bronze with a spectacular finish and vastly improved his PB. Early in 2017 he ran the fastest time ever recorded in April, but an injury put an end to his season. In 2018 he won the US Championships. In the fast London  race he came second in the second fastest time of his career. 
David Mutinda Mutua  
 As a young talent he became World Junior Champion in 2010. In 2011 he rose to international level breaking 1:44 in Monaco. He hardly raced at top level after that. 
Joseph Mwengi Mutua  
 Showed early promise when he became World Junior Champion in 1996. Qualified for the 2000 Olympics but did not get past the heats. Improved strongly in 2001, breaking 1:45 and later 1:44 as well, although qualification for the WC eluded him. In 2002 he won silver at the CW games. He was also the only one to beat  that season when winning in Zurich. He had a steady season in 2003 but just missed qualification for the WC at the demanding Kenyan trials. Started well in 2004, setting a new African indoor record (1:44.71i). At the Olympics he could not get past the semifinals. His 2005 season was unexpectedly mediocre. In 2006 he was the starting runner of the Kenyan relay team (with ,  and ) that set a new 4x800 WR (7:02.43) in Brussels. He hardly ran in 2007 and retired in 2008. He had an unusual running style holding his arms rather wide. 
Patrick Ndururi 
 Burst onto the international scene midway through 1997 with a string of excellent races. He came 2nd during 's WR race in Zurich, going well below 1:43, which made him second fastest of the year and also lifted him to (then) nr. 7 on the all time list. Finished 2nd in the 1997 African championships. During the 1997 WC final he managed only to finish 7th. In 1998 an early win in Rome (with another sub-1:43 run) seemed to make him favourite to rule the year in which  was returning from malaria, but despite breaking 1:44 three more times he was eclipsed by young . In 1999 he was unable to break 1:45 again, and after that season he disappeared from the circuit as quickly as he had arrived. 
Jean-Patrick Nduwimana 
 Ran as a young talent in major races as early as 1996. Made his breakthrough late in 2000 when he reached the semifinal at the Olympics. In 2001 he very promisingly ran sub-1:43 and was third fastest of the season, although he was unable to get past the WC semifinal. He missed the entire 2002 season, and although he reappeared in 2003 he came never anywhere close to his earlier level again. 
Noah Ngeny 
 For a few brief years young Ngeny's star shone gloriously at the middle distances, although he was mostly active at 1500m. In 1998 he was already ranked fourth and in 1999 he took silver at the World Championships. He ran El Guerrouj very close during a World Record race at the mile and in Rieti he managed to take a World Record himself as he improved 's long standing 1000m mark to 2:11.96. In 2000 he realised the unthinkable by winning a spectacular 1500m Olympic gold ahead of El Guerrouj. His 2001 season was still very good although he was left out of the Kenyan WC squad. A car accident severely affected his career from 2001 and he never quite regained his former levels before officially retiring in 2006. 
Stephen Ole-Marai 
 Finished 6th at the 1987 WC. Was also 2nd at the African Championships that same year. 
Andre Olivier       
 Scored an early success finishing 3rd at the 2008 World Junior Championships. Four years later he finished 3rd at the African Games and also managed to run  his first 1"44. At the Olympics he reached the semifinals. In 2013 he had a strong season, but sustained an injury just before the World Champs. Started well in 2014 and won a bronze medal at the Commonwealth games.  
Frederic Onyancha 
 Suddenly emerged in 1995, then in 1996 came through the Kenyan trials and won a splendid Olympic bronze in Atlanta in a very fast time. He ran a few more strong races in 1996 and also became African Champion that year. The following year he failed to impress however. After 1997 good performances became rare, and he was never able to make any further international impact. 
Andrew Osagie       
 His international career started seriously in 2011 when he finished 4th at the European Indoor Championships. At the outdoor WC he reached the semifinals. In 2012 he made huge  progress when he ran inside 1:45 several times. At the Olympic games he made the final and although he could only finish 8th he still ran a big PB as well. In 2013 he made yet another major final finishing fifth at the World Championships. At the 2014 World Indoor Championships he took a bronze medal. Suffered injury in 2015 and 2016, but returned in 2017. 
Ryszard Ostrowski 
 Came first at the Universiade in 1983 and again in 1985. In that final he set his PB, which was also a Polish record that would stand for 16 years. At the 1986 European Championships he finished 5th. His greatest success came in 1987 when he finished fourth at the World Championships. He reached the quarterfinal at the 1988 Olympics and the semis at the 1990 EC. His son Artur is a talented middle distance runner as well. 
Steve Ovett 
 Very allround and at times controversial middle distance runner. His first international glory came with a European junior title in 1973, followed by a silver medal at the 1974 EC. Came 5th at the 1976 Olympics.  At the 1978 EC he obtained another silver at the 800m and surpassed that with winning gold at the 1500m. In the years 1980-1983 he set 4 World records on the 1500m and mile. At the Moscow Olympics he snatched gold on the 800m ahead of favourite . Several days later he was favoured to win the 1500m as well but had to settle for bronze as  ran out the winner that time. His last 800m action was an 8th place at the 1984 Olympics. 
Don Paige 
 Set the fastest time of the year in 1980, but unluckily he was unable to compete in Moscow due to the Olympic boycott by the USA. 
Jose (Tony) Parrilla  
 Set an impressive PB at a young age, but was unable to run that fast again in later years. His best result was a 6th place at the 1995 WC. 
Roberto Parra 
 Showed great promise in 1996 winning the European Indoors title and setting his PB winning the European cup, but could later never find that form again. 
Rashid Ramzi 
 Switched from Morocco to Bahrain to enjoy better training facilities. The first real indication of world class was during the 2004 indoor season when he took silver at the WIC. At the 2005 WC at Helsinki he completed an improbable double, winning gold at both 1500m and 800m after six gruelling races within 9 days. In 2007 he was not seen until the WC where he took silver at the 1500m but was eliminated in the 800m semifinals. In 2008 he finished first at the Olympic 1500m, but was later found to have used a prohibited substance and suspended until May 2011. 
Gary Reed  
 The first Canadian to break 1:45 (in 2004). Joined the international top class in 2005 when he broke his own national record three more times. Reached the final at the WC, finishing 8th. Improved his national record twice more in 2006, breaking 1:44 in the process. He ran very well in 2007 and was rewarded with a silver at the WC, being only a fraction away from becoming the 2007 World Champion before being denied on the line by . Started well in 2008 and ran yet another national record in Monaco. At the Olympics he left his sprint finish just too late and finished fourth. In 2009 he looked in good shape but was eliminated in the semis of the WC. In 2010 he announced his retirement. His Canadian record stood for a further ten years until it was finally broken by   in 2018. 
Antonio Manuel Reina  
 Made his first international impact winning a bronze medal at the 2002 European Indoors. During the outdoor season he substantially improved the nine year old Spanish record and ended a splendid season with winning the World Cup and becoming the first Spaniard to break 1:44 - his national record would stand for  ten years until it was broken in 2012 by . By comparison his 2003 season was disappointing reaching only the semifinals at the WC. In 2004 he did reach his former levels, but just missed out on the  Olympic final. In 2005 he took silver at the European Indoor Champs, but at the outdoor WC he went out at the semifinal stage once more. Injuries troubled him  for many years although he managed to reach the semis at the 2008 Olympics. But in 2011 he came back at international levels and made the WC semifinal for a third time. In 2012 he broke 1:45 for the first time since 2005 and made the final at the EC, finishing fourth. He also reached the Olympic semifinal for a third time.  He retired in 2016. 
Michael Rimmer       
 As a young talent he already made the final at the 2006 European Championships, finishing 8th. He reached the semis at the 2007 WC and again at the Olympics in 2008. He also broke 1:45 for the first time that year. He made no real progress in 2009 going out in the semis again at the WC. But in 2010 he improved his PB and later took silver at the European Championships. In Rieti he vastly improved his PB again during  world record race. His 2011 season was troublesome and at the WC he went out in the heats. In 2012 he was not in great shape and at the Olympics he failed to make the semis. He had a minor comeback in 2015 but could not qualify from the heats of the World Championships. In 2016 he made the Olympic semifinals.  
James Robinson 
 Easily the best US 800m runner between 1976 and 1984. He won seven US titles in nine years and became Pan-American Champion in 1979. The Olympic boycott prevented him from taking part in Moscow. Sixth at the 1983 World Championships. He set his PB at the 1984 US trials but in the thrilling final finished only 4th in the same time as 3rd place, thereby very unluckily missing Olympic qualification in possibly his best season. 
Khadevis Robinson 
 Already US champion in 1999 he has been steadily improving since. In 2002 he broke 1:45 for the first time. Reached the semifinals at the 2003 WC.  Qualified for the 2004 Olympics. Scored three more US titles in 2005-2007. In 2005 he reached the semis at the WC. Had an excellent 2006 season, with a total of three PB's breaking 1:44 in the process. Reached the semis at the 2007 WC. In 2008 he could only reach 4th at the US trials missing Olympic selection. In 2009 he reached the semis at the WC. In 2010 he regularly acted as pacemaker but in 2011 he was back at elite level and managed to reach the WC semifinals for the fifth time in succession. Qualified for the Olympics but could not qualify from his heat and retired afterwards. 
Brandon Rock 
 American champion in 1995. Came 5th in the World Championships that year. 
Vebjorn Rodal 
 Put himself on the map in 1994 when he became the fastest native European for four years finishing second in Oslo (behind ) in 1:43.50. Later that year he took silver at the EC. He also won a bronze medal at the 1995 WC. Although unable to match , Rodal had a fantastic season in 1996, breaking 1:44 seven times (only  and  have ever done better). He took full advantage of the Dane's absence in Atlanta winning Olympic gold in a new Olympic record. His 1997 season was less exciting although he still reached the WC final, finishing 5th. In 1998 he reached his last major final winning bronze at the European Indoor Championships. 
Abraham Kipchirchir Rotich      
 A Kenyan middle distance talent he ran a modest 1:47.89 in 2011, but early in 2012 he improved impressively breaking 1:45. During the summer he won two quick races in Belgium within a week, lowering his PB by more than half a second each time. After yet another win in Monaco he looked likely to grow into a world class athlete pretty soon. On May 1st 2013 he switched nationalities and became a citizen of Bahrein. He was later unable to repeat his 2012 performances however, although in 2015 he did make the semis at the World Championships. 
Laban Rotich 
 Despite an impressive PB on the 800m predominantly a 1500m runner. On that distance he was 4th at the 1996 Olympics, African Champion in 1998, and also CW champion in 1998. 
Michael Rotich 
 In 2003 he appeared as yet another promising Kenyan runner, showing great improvement in 2004. Qualified for the Olympics but went out in the heats. Wasn't seen at elite levels after that.   
David Rudisha       
 Current World Record holder, double World Champion, double Olympic Champion and arguably the best 800m athlete ever. World Junior Champion in 2006. In 2007 he won a number of minor races before a surprise win in Zurich. He comprehensively showed his class by beating a very strong field in Brussels in a big PB. Early in 2008 he totally dominated the field at the African games and also won in Doha. He set a new PB in Oslo. Illness meant he could not qualify for the Olympics. He set a new PB early in 2009 but in the sudden coldness at the WC he just failed to reach the final. In Zurich he beat a strong field. He won again in Brussels and scored a terrific win in Rieti in 1:42.01, a brilliant new African record finally beating  from 1984 and making him 4th fastest athlete of all time. He also won the World Athletics final.  In 2010 his season was a fairytale story. He showed stunning early form running 1:43.15 in the first week of March. At the Doha Diamond League race he was a convincing winner in an even faster time, but in Oslo he improved that by almost a second winning in a spectacular 1:42.04. A further fast win in Lausanne made him the Diamond leader with distance. He followed that with a blistering new African record of 1:41.51 in Heusden, the third fastest race ever. A few weeks later he became African Champion in Nairobi in 1:42.84, by far the fastest time ever run in Africa beating the mark by . Astoundingly after such a long season he was still in perfect shape to attack the World Record and in Berlin he beat the old mark by , improving it by just two hundredths of a second to 1:41.09. He won the Diamond League by finishing first in Brussels. Still far from tired he went to Rieti where two days later he incredibly improved his own World Record to 1:41.01. He finished off 2010 reigning supreme in the Continental Cup race.  Early in 2011 he already showed excellent form in Australia. Ran a very fast race in Monaco and also became Kenyan Champion. In London he beat his closest rival  and went below 1:43 once more. In Daegu he became World Champion dominating the race from start to finish. In Rieti he set a seasons best mark and came very close to his own world record. In  Brussels he was victorious again which meant he won the 2011 Diamond League as well. Tired after a long season he was just beaten in the rain in Milan by .  In 2012 he started well with a convincing win in Doha. In New York he once more showed dazzling speed setting the fastest time ever run in North America and breaking 1:42 for the fifth time, the first athlete ever to do so. At the Kenyan trials he was a commanding winner in 1:42.12,   improving his own fastest time ever run in Africa. In Paris he ran yet another fantastic 1:41. At the Olympic Games in London he delivered the most stunning 800m race of all time. Leading from start to finish he not only took gold but improved his own World Record as well. In doing so he also became the first athlete to break the 1:41 barrier. His season ended with his only defeat, once again in poor weather, when he lost to  in Zurich.  His 2013 season was cut short by an injury after a win in the Diamond League opener. In 2014 he returned and won impressively in Glasgow. But in a very fast race in Monaco he could only finish fifth. At the Commonwealth games he was trumped by  and took silver.   In 2015 he won a Diamond Leauge meeting but in Lausanne he was beaten once more by . At the WC in Beijing though he led the final from start to finish and became World Champion  for the second time in his career. In 2016 he looked vulnerable in his early races but he did  set the fastest time of the year shortly before the Olympics. In the Olympic final he ran a  stunning low 1:42 taking a glorious gold and retained his title in majestic fashion.   In 2017 he hardly ran and he had to withdraw from the WC due to an injury. 
Paul Ruto 
 Enjoyed a brief but successful career after he started training seriously when already in his mid-twenties. Was first seen on the circuit in 1991. In 1993 he won a silver medal at the African Championships. In that year he also made the Kenyan team for the World  Championships and became a surprise World Champion in a final without clear favourites.  He finished the season with a new PB but amazingly he already retired the following year. 
Jim Ryun 
 World class middle distance runner during the sixties. In 1966 he set a world record on 880 yards (1:44.9m), which, although not recognized, was equivalent to 1:44.3m at 800m, the world record at the time. He clocked three further world records at the mile (1966 and again in 1967) and 1500m (1967). At the 1968 Olympic Games he won silver at 1500m. 
Donato Sabia 
 Emerged in 1984 becoming European Indoor Champion. Made the Olympic final and finished 5th. Remained invisible for three seasons but again reached the Olympic final in 1988, coming home in 7th place. Was never seen at top level after that. 
Djabir Said-Guerni 
 Had a spectacular breakthrough in 1999, winning a bronze medal at the WC in Seville (improving his PB in every round). He confirmed his talents late in 1999 improving the Algerian record by a massive 1.5 seconds. In 2000 he had a number of fascinating duels with , each winning a number of Grand Prix races. He won the African championships as well. He was seen as a firm favourite for the 2000 Sydney Olympics, but he mistimed his efforts and had to settle for bronze. An Achilles tendon injury ruined his 2001 season. He returned in 2002 and without quite reaching his former levels he won the African Championships. In 2003 he competed just a few times, but at the World Championships he timed his race to perfection and scored the biggest success of his career with an unexpected gold medal. In 2004 he didn't race often but still made the Olympic final and finished in seventh place. In 2005 he looked below par, but did well to finish 5th when defending his world title. In 2007 he announced his retirement due to lack of motivation after many injuries. 
Michael Saruni       
 This Kenyan runner started his career in the USA, where he jumped onto the big stage by setting an NCAA record of 1:43.25. Early in 2019 he made the headlines again by running 1:43.98i at the Millrose Games, which was not only an African Indoor Record but also made him the second fastesr indoor runner ever behind . 
Nils Schumann 
 Shrewd tactician with relatively modest pace (he never managed to run below 1:44) but a very sharp finish. First sign of his class was winning the 1998 European Indoor Championships. In the same year he became European Champion as well (aged only 20). At the WC in 1999 he made the final and finished 8th. In 2000 he won a silver medal at the European Indoor Championships. His greatest triumph came later that year when he won an unexpected gold medal in the tactical Olympic final. The 2001 WC saw him finish in 5th place. His last success came at the 2002 EC where he picked up another bronze medal. Two operations on his Achilles tendon kept him away from any competition during the next four seasons. He reappeared in 2007, but was unable to really compete at international level. After failing to qualify for the 2009 WC in his home country he decided to retire. 
Hezekiel Sepeng  
 Remarkably consistent performer. The only athlete to break 1:46 from 1993-2004. Already made the 1993 WC final (aged 19) and came 5th. His first international success was a silver medal at the 1994 Commonwealth games. In 1996 he first broke 1:45, then 1:44, and eventually even 1:43 when he took silver in a dazzling Olympic final and became the first black South African athlete to win an Olympic track medal. In 1997 expectations were high but he could not find his real form until after the World Championships. The following year was unspectacular, but he did win another silver at the 1998 CW games. In 1999 he had a terrific season and it was only the return of  that prevented him from winning several international meetings. At the WC he came close to his first major title but again was beaten (although by the narrowest of margins) by  and had to settle for yet another silver. Later that year though he broke his PB in Brussels. In 2000 he had a steady season, finishing 4th in the Olympic final. Another strong year in 2001 saw him make the WC final but this time he only finished 8th. He seemed rather out of touch in 2002, but 2003 saw a welcome return to form when he reached his fourth WC final (finishing 7th) and ran his fastest time for four years in Brussels. In 2004 he reached the Olympic final for the third consecutive time, finishing sixth.  Has broken 1:45 over 40 times and can also show 14 sub-1:44 marks (only , ,  and  have more). Usually ran wearing dark glasses. Unfortunately in 2005 he got involved in a doping affair and was suspended for two years, which effectively ended his career. 
David Sharpe 
 Showed early promise when he became the 1988 European Indoor Champion. Second at the 1990 European Championhips. Set his PB winning the 1992 Zurich B-race. Persistent injuries prevented a further career in athletics. 
Peter Snell 
 Set his mark when he was an unexpected winner of Olympic gold in 1960 just ahead of Belgian favourite and world record holder Roger Moens. Dominated middle distance running in the early sixties. In 1962 he set a WR at the mile, and added WR's at 800m/880y in the same race one week later. His time was the first ever below the 1:45 barrier (his new WR of 1:44.3m was an improvement of 1.4 seconds). He also won gold (at 880y) at the CW games in Perth that same year. In 1964 he defended his Olympic 800m title (in the second fastest time ever) and convincingly added a 1500m gold a few days later. 
Duane Solomon  
 Was a national class athlete from 2007-2011 but unable to really break through until 2012. In that year he finished 3rd in the Olympic trials breaking 1:45. Improved himself by more than a second during the Monaco meeting. During the Olympic final he finished fourth but improved his PB by a big margin again. In 2013 he ran very fast to become American champion.  He was victorious in a fast race in Monaco as well. He led the World Championship final for most of the race but in the end had to settle for sixth. Ran fast in 2014 as early as April and became American Champion once more. That was effectively his last active year as well. 
Bram Som       
 As a young talent he went well below 1:45 in 2000 and again in 2001. The following season he could not improve but still finished 6th at the 2002 EC. He had a number of confident Grand Prix races in 2003, but was unable to get past the semifinals at the WC. Started well in 2004 winning in Hengelo, but after an injury he just missed a place in the Olympic final. Another injury spoiled his entire 2005 season. He refound his old level in 2006 and became European Champion when he clinched a tactical race with a very late effort. He also broke the Dutch record when he finished second in Zurich. After an injury 2007 and 2008 were disappointing and at the 2007 WC he went out in the heats. Reappeared strongly in 2009. At the WC he was tripped in the semi but still put into the final, finishing seventh. Also ran well in Rieti. Ran well in 2010 but unluckily fell ill just before the European Championships. Couldn't quite find top form in 2011 but still made the semifinals at the WC. For the past few years he is among the most popular pacemakers.  
Ayanleh Souleiman       
 Souleiman usually runs at 1500m and he took silver at the 2012 African champs on that distance. In 2013 though he suddenly ran a very sharp 800m national record at a minor meeting in Sweden. He performed very well at the World Championships in Moscow and managed to take the bronze. In 2015 he won the first Diamond League meeting and also set a world lead in Barcelona. A week  later he improved himself to 1:42. During the 2016 indoor season he set a new World Indoor Record of 2:14.20 at 1000m improving  16 year old mark. At he Olympics he didn't manage to qualify for the final. Didn't run in 2017. 
Martin Steele  
 Totally unexpectedly enjoyed a one-off triumph in Oslo 1993 late in his career when he ran the race  of his life and triumphed in the second fastest time of the season. Retired shortly after that. 
Luciano Susanj 
 Became European Indoor Champion in 1974, then followed that up by winning the 1984 European Championship. In 1976 he finished 6th in the Olympic final. 
Nick Symmonds  
 Improved vastly during the 2006 season. In 2007 he won at the Pre classic breaking 1:45 in the process. He finished 6th during the 2008 World Indoor Championships. Outdoors he ran a new PB as he came first at the US trials. At the Olympic games he reached the semifinals. In 2009 he was US Champion once more. Later that year he ran a new PB breaking 1:44 for the first time. At the WC he made the final finishing sixth. Again US Champion in 2010. In Rieti he improved his PB during  world record race. In 2011 he was US Champion again and made another WC final finishing in fifth place. In 2012 he became US Champion for the fifth time in succession. Finished fifth during the very fast Olympic final improving his PB by almost a second. Ran well in 2013 and won the London Diamond League meeting. In Moscow he finally scored a major medal as he took silver at the World Championships. He proceeded to win the race in Zurich and also ran very fast in Brussels. In 2015 he won the US trials, but sadly did not participate at the World Championships after  a major dispute over the rights to wear the logo of his private sponsor. He retired in 2017. 
Wiliam Tanui 
 World class middle distance runner, although he didn't start training until already 21. In his first international year on the 800m (1990) he dominated the season. He became African Champion in 1990 and again the next year, even if his 1991 season was somewhat disappointing. He reached the peak of his career in 1992 though, crowning his season with the gold medal at the Olympic games. In later years he couldn't quite find the pace needed at 800m, although he was still 7th at the 1993 WC. After 1994 he switched mostly to 1500m. In 1996 he finished 5th in the Olympic 1500m final. After finishing his competitive career he remained active for quite a few years as an expert pacemaker at 1500m. 
Norberto Tellez  
 Originally a 400m runner (won 400m gold at the 1995 PanAm games). He improved strongly in 1996 when he produced a string of good results. Came fourth in the Olympic final in the fastest ever time for 4th place in any race. In later years he was unable to break 1:44 again, but he still won silver at the 1997 WC and finished 4th at the 1999 WC. 
Joseph Tengelei  
 Among the most regular runners of the mid-nineties. Made the semifinal in the 1995 WC, but unable to make any major finals. Set his PB in one of those famous fast B-races in Zurich. He was the pacemaker in Zurich 1997 when  lowered the World record to 1:41.24. 
Tomas de Teresa 
 Won silver medals at the 1990 European and 1991 World Indoor Championships. At the 1994 European Championships he won a bronze medal. 
Sammy Tirop  
 Totally unknown when he made the Kenyan team for the 1990 CW games when already in his thirties. Unexpectedly won gold in the very tactical and thereby rather unpredictable final. He was never seen again on the circuit. 
Amel Tuka      
 Ran 1:46 in 2013 and 2014 and came sixth at the 2014 European Championships. Improved himself tremendously in 2015 when he ran 1:44, setting a new PB by almost  two seconds. A few weeks later he did even better running 1:43 in Madrid. Stunningly he then also beat a very strong field at the Monaco Diamond League  meeting in 1:42.51, the fastest time run in 2015, which put him from nowhere almost  in the all time top ten. At the World Championships he won a bronze medal. In 2016 his season was a bit disappointing and he was eliminated in his Olympic semifinal. In 2017 he was unable to come through the heats of the World Championship. 
Einars Tupuritis 
 Had a successful year in 1996 when he reached the Olympic semifinal and lowered the Latvian 800m record to an internationally respected time. Still holds that national record to this day.  
Giuseppe d'Urso 
 Finished 7th at the EC in 1990, but his biggest success was his silver medal at the 1993 World Championships. In 1994 he finished 5th at the European Championships. In 1996 he won silver at the European Indoor Championships. 
Ivo Van Damme 
 A fantastic young talent, Ivo won his first international medal at the 1975 European Indoor Championships (silver). A year later he convincingly became European Indoor Champion. At the 1976 Olympic games he fulfilled all expectations winning silver at both 800m and 1500m after two brilliant runs. He confirmed his talents in several races later that season and appeared destined for many records and championships, but tragically died in a road accident in December 1976. His over 30 years old Belgian 800m record still stands to this day and has not even been threatened. Each year in Brussels the famous Ivo Van Damme memorial is held in remembrance of his talents. 
Lukas Vydra 
 Won a bronze medal at the 1998 European Championships in what turned out to be his best season. 
Nicholas Wachira 
 One of many Kenyan middle distance talents. World Youth Champion in 1999 and World  Junior Champion in 2000. Reached the semifinals at the 2001 and 2003 WC. After 2004 he was never seen again at top level and in the end he never came close to fulfilling his potential. 
Alan Webb 
 Widely regarded as an exceptional talent he already recorded impressive marks (1:47 at 800m, 3:38 at 1500) when only 18. Three years later, in 2004, he rose to top level, although he went out in the heats of the 1500m at the Olympics. He made the 2005 WC 1500m final, finishing 9th. In 2007 he displayed astonishing form as he won the 1500m in Paris in a world leading PB, and next broke the North-American mile record with 3:46.91. Only a week later he unexpectedly beat a strong 800m field, improving his PB by two seconds and propelling himself to world class at the 800m as well. His results at the 2007 WC were disappointing however. In 2008 and 2009 his performances dropped dramatically and he never reached world class levels again. 
Rick Wohlhuter 
 Prolific middle distance runner, who might well have claimed more world records if his career hadn't flourished during the last years of the Anglo-Saxon tradition of running imperial (non-metric) distances. In 1973 he clocked 1:44.6y at the 880 yards, comparable to 1:44.0m for 800m (existing WR was 1:44.3m). One year later he ran 1:44.1y (comparable to 1:43.5m, WR was 1:43.7m). In the same year he did set a new world best for the 1000m (2:13.9m). US Champion at 800m (or 880y) in 1973 and 1974. In 1976 he started as favourite for the Olympic 800m but had to settle for bronze. 
Dave Wottle 
 US Champion at 800m in 1972. Became a candidate for Olympic gold when equalling the WR (1:44.3m) at the 1972 American trials. A remarkable demonstration of even pace running brought him Olympic gold in the last stride. Because of his habit to run wearing an old golf cap he was known as the 'man with the cap'. 
Willi Wulbeck 
 German middle distance runner. In 1974 he made the final at the European Chanpionships. Two years later he finished 4th in the 1976 Olympic final. In 1980 he was unable to participate at the Olympics because of the boycott. Made another EC final in 1982. Enjoyed enormous success in 1983 when late in his career he won the first ever World Championship title in what is still the German record to this day. In that same year he became German Champion for an incredible tenth time in a row. 
William Wuyke 
 Emerged in 1984 breaking his own national record several times to bring it below 1:44. In 1986 a number of wins made him one of the leading 800m athletes of the season. After 1987 he was rarely seen in major races. He is still the only South-American non-Brazilian athlete to ever break 1:44. 
Alfred Kirwa Yego  
 After a 2nd place at the 2004 WJC he improved tremendously in 2005. He came 2nd at the Kenyan trials and even won in Rome. He went out in the heats at the WC. Set a new PB winning the Lausanne B-race in 2006 and improved further in Rieti. Early in 2007 he ran poorly but after switching to a new trainer he excelled in Osaka where he put in a tremendous final dash and became World Champion aged only 20. His 2008 season did not start too well but a fine win in Eugene showed improving form. A fast finish ensured him of a bronze medal at the Olympic games. In 2009 a win in Rome confirmed his continued good form. At the WC he nearly defended his title but had to be content with a silver medal. He also came second in a new PB in Zurich, second in Brussels and again in Rieti in a splendid new PB breaking 1:43 for the first time. In 2010 he came 2nd at the African Championships behind the unstoppable  but apart from one other race his season was unspectacular. Made the WC final in 2011 finishing seventh. In 2012 he failed to qualify for the Olympics. 
William Yiampoy  
 Did not appear on the circuit until 1999, but after that was a very consistent runner. He reached the Olympic semifinal in 2000. In 2001 he showed a lot of progress, breaking 1:44, becoming Kenyan Champion and finishing 4th at the Edmonton World Championships. He did even better the following year when in his last race of the season he broke 1:43, one of only three athletes to do so during 2002. In 2003 he hardly ran after a few disappointing races early in the season. He bounced right back in 2004 when after just missing Olympic qualification he became African Champion, won in Paris and finished 2nd in Zurich and Brussels. In 2005 he did qualify for the WC and crowned his career with a splendid bronze medal. Another solid season in 2006 saw him win the Zurich B-race. He also ran the fastest leg in the Kenyan relay team (with ,  and ) that set a new 4x800 WR (7:02.43) in Brussels. On that highlight he concluded his career.
